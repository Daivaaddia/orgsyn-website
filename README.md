## Organic Synthesis Reaction Pathway Finder

An organic chemistry reaction pathway generator that finds all the reaction pathways from one compound to another. All info is taken from Cambridge curriculum high school sources (and some from memory ðŸ‘½). 

All information is dynamically generated in javascript and it utilises a depth first search graph traversal algorithm to find pathways.
